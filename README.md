# MUSIC STORE Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project shows how to analyze data using SQL queries. It includes finding important information like top customers, best cities for business, and popular music genres by country. The goal is to learn how to use data to help businesses make smart decisions.

## Data Used
The project uses a dataset about customers, invoices, music tracks, and artists. It shows how to join tables and use functions to answer real questions.

## What I Did
- Wrote SQL queries to explore and analyze music store data including tables like employees, customers, invoices, tracks, genres, and artists.

- Found the senior-most employee by sorting employees based on their job levels.

- Counted and ranked countries by the number of invoices generated to identify top markets.

- Extracted the highest invoice totals and identified the best customers by total spending.

- Dissected data by city and country to find regions with the highest revenue.

- Analyzed customer preferences, especially those who listen to Rock music.

- Used joins and window functions to find artists with the most Rock tracks and tracks longer than the average track length.

- Calculated total spending for each customer on the top-selling artist.

- Discovered the most popular genre per country by analyzing customer music preferences.

- Identified the top-spending customer from each country using window ranking functions.

- Applied various SQL functions and techniques: aggregates (SUM, COUNT, AVG), grouping, subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions (ROW_NUMBER).


## How to Use
Open the SQL files or scripts and run them on the sample database to see the results. You can change the queries to explore other questions in the data.
